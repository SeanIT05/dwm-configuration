# DWM-Dotfiles
DWM Dotfiles I use for Archlinux and Gentoo

This is MY WAY of installing and configuring dwm on my Archlinux and Gentoo machine. Therefore it shouldn't be seen as a guide on how your DWM should look like, but rather an inspiration for your own DWM configuration.

# Dependencies
Most of these are in the standard Arch/Gentoo repositories. If not please have a look in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).
- xsetroot
- Xorg
- hack font
- dmenu
- dwm
- alacritty
- bashtop
- setxkbmap
- picom
- dunst
- oh my bash
- nitrogen/feh
- Nerd Font Symbols
- lsd

# Mentions
- I use DT's configuration for Alacritty, which you can find [here](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml)
- It looks exactly the same on my Gentoo machine. Iam quite new to Gentoo, so the make.conf probably won't look very professional.
