# DWM-Dotfiles
DWM Dotfiles I use for Archlinux and Gentoo

This is MY WAY of installing and configuring dwm on my Archlinux and Gentoo machine. Therefore it shouldn't be seen as a guide on how your DWM should look like, but rather an inspiration for your own DWM configuration.

# Dependencies
Most of these are in the standard Arch/Gentoo repositories. If not please have a look in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).
- Xorg
- Jet Brains Mono font
- alacritty
- htop
- setxkbmap 
- picom
- feh
- Nerd Font Symbols
- libXft (gentoo)
- libXinerama (gentoo)

Read the compile error of dwm, dmenu and slstatus. It indicates missing libraries.

#### The goal is for it to be minimal...

# Mentions
- This works on basically any distro
- I use this on multiple of my gentoo machines
